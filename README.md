# Mesto
It`s a student project that appeared to train skills in the field of web designing. Here you can see files organized in BEM model(at least I hope so), grids, flexboxes and the main thing- the author(me) tried to adopt this page to different devices width(at least I hope so). First time I used JS to make some functions as popup appearing and closing, editing information.
